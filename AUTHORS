The elementary icons are designed and developed by
Daniel Foré <daniel@elementaryos.org> at https://github.com/elementary/icons.

This variant - supporting all Desktop Environments, but developed for Xfce
- is currently maintained by Simon Steinbeiß <simon@xfce.org>.
It still holds many of the symlinks that upstream elementary dropped.
